		Problem 4

Sam has a three-year auto loan at an 8.5% annual interest rate.
His original loan was $7920.
His monthly payment is $250.
He has made payments on the loan for the past 18 months;
he wants to know the payoff balance.
Write a program to determine the payoff balance of Sam's auto loan.
Prompt and answer in complete sentences.
The applicable formula appears below:

b = (ob * z) - p * ((z - 1)/i)

where:

b = payoff balance
ob = original balance
z = Math.pow(1 + i, n - k)
p = monthly payment
i = monthly interest rate
k = number of payments already made
n = total number of monthly payments
		!-->
		
        <script>
	function show_prompt() {
	var b;
	var ob = parseFloat(prompt("Please enter the original balance."));
	var p = parseFloat(prompt("Please enter the monthly payment."));
	var z;
	var k = parseFloat(prompt("Please enter the number of months paid on the loan."));
	var n = parseFloat(prompt("Please enter the total number of months on the loan."));
	var i = parseFloat(prompt("Please enter the rate on the loan."));

	var i = (i / 100) / 12;

	var z = Math.pow(1 + i, n - k);

	var b = (ob * z) - p * ((z - 1) / i);

	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
		"The amount to pay off your loan is " +
		b.toFixed(2)
		".  Thank you for using this program.";
